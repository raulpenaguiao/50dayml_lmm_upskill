# Day 35: Evaluation Metrics for NLP Models

## 🎯 Goal
Master evaluation metrics specific to NLP tasks including BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Classification metrics review
- BLEU score for translation
- ROUGE for summarization
- Perplexity for language models
- Human evaluation considerations

---

## 📝 Syllabus

### 1. Classification Metrics
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1
- Macro vs micro vs weighted
- Multi-class vs multi-label
- ROC-AUC for NLP

### 2. Generation Metrics
- BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
- ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
- METEOR
- CIDEr

### 3. Language Model Metrics
- Perplexity calculation
- Cross-entropy loss
- Bits per character
- Interpretation

### 4. Advanced Metrics
- BERTScore
- BLEURT
- Human evaluation
- A/B testing
