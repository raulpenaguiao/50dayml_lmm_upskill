# Day 16: Attention Mechanisms

## 🎯 Goal
Learn attention mechanisms that revolutionized NLP and paved the way for Transformers.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Motivation for attention
- Attention scores and weights
- Additive (Bahdanau) attention
- Multiplicative (Luong) attention
- Soft vs hard attention
- Self-attention preview

## 📝 Syllabus

### 1. Why Attention?
- Information bottleneck problem
- Long sequences challenge
- Alignment problem in translation
- Attention as solution

### 2. Attention Mechanism
- Query, Key, Value concept
- Attention scores computation
- Softmax for attention weights
- Context vector as weighted sum

### 3. Attention Variants
- Bahdanau (additive) attention

- Scaled dot-product attention
- Implementation differences

### 4. Attention in Seq2Seq
- Encoder-decoder attention
- Attending to source sequence
- Visualization of attention weights
- Improved translation quality

## ✅ Tasks

1. **Implement Attention**
   - Build attention module
   - Integrate with seq2seq
   - Train on translation task

2. **Visualize Attention**
   - Create attention heatmaps
   - Analyze attention patterns
   - Verify alignment quality

3. **Compare Architectures**
   - Seq2seq without attention
   - Seq2seq with attention
   - Measure BLEU scores

4. **Attention Analysis**
   - Study attention weights
   - Identify failure cases
   - Understand what model learns
