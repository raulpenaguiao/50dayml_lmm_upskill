# Day 2: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification

## üéØ Goal
Understand and implement a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch for image classification on the MNIST dataset.  
Learn how CNNs improve performance over simple MLPs for image data.

- CNN architecture: convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, fully connected layers
- PyTorch modules for CNNs (`nn.Conv2d`, `nn.MaxPool2d`, `nn.ReLU`, `nn.Flatten`, `nn.Linear`)
- Training and evaluating a CNN on MNIST
- Comparing CNN vs MLP performance
