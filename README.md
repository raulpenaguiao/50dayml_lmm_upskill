# 🚀 ML/LLM 50-Day Upskill Course

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This course is designed for people with **graduate-level mathematics** (Master's degree or equivalent). If you don't have strong foundations in linear algebra, calculus, probability, and optimization, please start with foundational courses first.

## 💡 Idea of the Course
This course is designed to **upskill software engineers with strong mathematical backgrounds into ML/LLM engineers** within 50 days (3-4 hours per day).

**Target Audience:**
- Software engineers with MS/PhD in quantitative fields (Math, Physics, CS, Engineering, Statistics)
- Researchers transitioning to ML engineering
- Quantitative professionals (finance, physics) moving into AI
- Anyone with graduate-level math who wants hands-on ML implementation skills

Through a mix of theory and hands-on projects, participants will leverage their mathematical foundation to quickly master machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs).

By the end, you will have completed **5 portfolio-ready projects** that demonstrate your skills and prepare you for an ML/LLM Engineer role.
